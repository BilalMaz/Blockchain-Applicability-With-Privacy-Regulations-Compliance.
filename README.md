Series part 1 GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)

Topic 1 : Understanding of GDPR and Blockchain Compatibility

By : Bilal Mazhar GDPR / ISMS Implementation Consultant

Topic Introduction :

As we all know technology changes very rapidly and it is very important for an information security consultant to up to update regarding the technologies & regulations like Blockchain and GDPR but the main problem occur because regulations are made accordance to concern country but technology in mind.

Topic Problem statement :

Blockchain technology revolutionized the way we keep record of the data by providing the services like integrity , non-repudiation using the hashing cryptographic and in easy word if if organization uses blockchain their less chances their data can tempered because all node will have their own ledger so they can verify the record no one can delete and update record so these features blockchain provide but on the other hand regulations like GDPR are enforced organization right to privacy to its citizen . Most interesting in article no : 17 of GDPR (General data protection regulation ) citizen can ask organization to delete his / her data organization so if organization using blockchain as a system for processing / storage of business information than What ?

or what if organization failed to perform deletion of his / her data ?

GDPR clearly states in article no : 84 regarding penalties

so !!!

it mean organization get easily penalized like this ?

or it better not use blockchain ?

at this point here the magician ! a Cyber security professional who understand both GDPR and Blockchain but how !!!!!!!!

Let see how !!!!!!

Once wise person said

" If things get difficult break difficulty in to small pieces. It easy to eat small pieces : ) "

so we will do like the same and we will break the GDPR and Blockchain in to small pieces.

If i ask you a three questions

Q1. What principle GDPR is stand on ?

Q2 . What Features Blockchain is providing ?

Q3. Is their any way we can integrate both

As a GDPR Consultant yes we can how let answer one by one
Q1. What principle GDPR is stand on ?

After studying GDPR I found

Territorial scope , processing of personal data , consent , Rights to information , Right to deletion of PI , Right to update PI , Transparency , Right to data portability , Right to object the processing , International transfer , Role and responsibilities ( Controller , data processor) , Consistency/Accuracy , security of the personal information

before start their some definition to remember

data subject , data controller , processing , personal information , portability , object

definition can be found here : https://advisera.com/eugdpracademy/gdpr/definitions/

GDPR Full Text can be found here :

Territorial scope

    Territorial scope mean process is take place in EU or outside the EU or control or processor process the information with in EU or outside the EU. If organization process the data subject (EU citizen) information GDPR can be applicable to that organization 

processing of personal data

there are principles required if you process the data subject information like

    organization will take the consent ( written permission ) from the concern data subject.
    organization will disclose the mean of the processing and its sharing.
    organization will disclose the what kind of right they will entertain.

consent

    Organization will take written permission from the data subject.

Rights to information

    data subjects can request to organization what kind of information they have 

Right to deletion of Personal information

    data subjects can request that his / her data should be deleted from the organization system 

Right to update Personal information

    data subject can ask if he / she think his / her information is not accurate or correct 

Transparency / Consistency/Accuracy

    organization should have accurate and complete data subject information with proper transparency controls 

Right to data portability

    data subject can ask organization about his / her information to get the copy of that information or even can request the organization to port the information 

Right to object the processing

    data subject can object the processing he / she can question like how , why , what type question from the organizations. 

International transfer

    Very important one : No you can transfer information outside the EU if you perform processing inside the EU. or organization processing outside the EU than organization is responsible for providing the proper security controls and take written consent from the concern data subject and will discloses that his / her information will be processed outside the EU.

more detail can be found here : https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/international-transfers/

So Now we have understand the requirement of GDPR that if we implement above mention points than we can say that we are compatible with GDPR .

so now i will not go into detail how blockchain which read can go and google it :) but yes i will discuss the major point which are required. let start integrating the blockchain with GDPR.

before i start explaining i implement the blockchain so architectural diagram as :

Private Blockchain

#####


Privacy Principle – 1 Territorial scope

    When organization deploying blockchain they should consider how they are deploying if they are deploying publicly than they violate the privacy principle -1 

this case organization violating 

###### 
It is difficult to track all the processing node whether they in EU or not so recommendation deploy private blockchain.

Privacy Principle – 2 lawful processing of personal data

    Ethereum support Distributed web application it is like traditional web application developed by HTML , CSS , JavaScript
    D app should include consent mechanism 


personal information in blockchain

blockchain can contain two categories of personal data:

    Public keys are used to identify and authorize user transactions on the blockchain and each public key points to a specific user
    Additional data (or payload): Besides the participants’ identifiers, the additional data stored on the blockchain can contain personal data that can potentially relate to individuals other than participants and miners.

Consent

Take permission from data subject to processing his/her information. Consent can implemented in two ways in blockchain :

    If organization have develop Distributed web application than by simply taken consent in any web form than append to blockchain
    Other way is Smart Contract is the best way to handle and store all the consent 

Information Access to personal information 

like every node is have there own copy of the data so data subject should be part of network so i can have he / her data.


Rectification / portability / Transparency / Consistency/Accuracy

    Due to immutability nature of Block-Chain data subject will not able to exercise its rights because one information added to Block-Chain. 

2 . it is important Conduct DPIA (Data impact analysis) before going for Block-Chain determine the mean and purpose of information that to push to blockchain.
Role and responsibility

Miners : Because miners only validate transactions submitted by participants and are not involved in the object of these transactions, they do not define the purposes and the means of the processing and, therefore, are not controllers. In some cases miners can be considered data processors

Participants (i.e. persons deciding to register data on a blockchain): Because participants determine the means and purposes of the processing they are considered data controllers

Smart Contract developer Smart developer who process the personal data on half of the data controller is consider as data processor 

There are still improvment required in GDPR compliance using Blockchain i did my research and little effeort

please do comment in comment how i can improve my research with help of my LinkedIn community
